# studiorack-core has been deprecated

StudioRack core was a prototype of an open-source audio plugin core functions. It showed what was possible by publishing reusable code and making it available to command line tools, apps and websites.

This core codebase required maintenance to keep up-to-date and was missing important features such as:

- Support for projects/presets
- Target specific operating systems and architectures
- File hashes for security
- Multiple plugin/archive formats

We have now combined forces with the Owlplug team, to define an open-source shared audio package manager specification and GitHub organization. The new core codebase supports those important features and will allow the standards to scale beyond StudioRack and Owlplug to other audio package managers.
